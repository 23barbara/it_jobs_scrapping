# it_jobs_scrapping
Simple code that uses web scrapping to filter IT Jobs from the Craigslist Website.
Could help developers looking for a job or specific position in IT.

The read_data.py file will read/scrap job listings from the URL provided to gather job postings.
It will then ouput the job titles to a file job-titles.txt
Job titles will then be pulled from the file and filtered by category (such as web development, data science, software...) in filter_data.py
